Most think of hacking as software manipulation.  Alterations to hardware is much more difficult to detect because it happens during the manufacturing process. Most of our computer hardware is manufactured in China making the hardware vulnerable to manipulation. Ensuring the security and integrity of the hardware during the supply chain process is necessary. 

1. A hardware hack entails the manipulation of the physical elements of a device with the intention of obtaining unauthorized access. A software hack focuses on manipulating flaws in the software system and applications.

2. Modification of hardware and adding external devices.

3. The attack by Chinese spies reached 30 major US companies, including Amazon and Apple, by compromising their technology supply chain.
